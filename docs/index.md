# **Patuxent River Watershed Geology**  
This map shows the unique geology of the HUC 8 Patuxent River Watershed located in the state of Maryland. The map offers a number of layers including the open source streetmap that comes with the QGIS application. The outline of Maryland is displayed in black and the outline of the Patuxent River Watershed is shown in blue. This data was downloaded from the BASINS 4.5 application. The unique geologic rocktypes are displayed in different colors on the map. Information on the rocktype age and type can be found by toggling over a geologic area of interest and clicking on it. The geologic data comes from the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) and can be accessed at (https://mrdata.usgs.gov/geology/state/state.php?state=MD).
